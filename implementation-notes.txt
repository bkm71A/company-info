Application is rather POC than actual production application:

1) Symbol/company life-cycle (mergers/splits/bankruptcies) is not implemented

2) List of Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) is hardcoded, rather than taken from https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI/components?p=%5EDJI

3) SQLite database was used for simplicity (for prod appliation should be more solid solution)

4) 'estimated annual revenue', 'number of employees' are actually functions of time, but treated as value

5) bugs exists, not fixed due to lack of time
  5.1) in industry, company URL, phone number xpath needs corrections
  5.2) zip code is loosing leading zeros

6) xpath expressions were done quick and dirty, might be impprooved to be more robust
